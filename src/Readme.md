1> Moving ball. Display is initialised. We are then displaying a circle moving across the screen.
2> Ball class is made. draw(), erase(), update() functions are written.
3> Paddle class is made with draw(), erase() and update() functions. Input is also read. delay() is used for timing control.
4> Ball class is used to make a bouncing ball, by adding some extra logic. No input, no paddle, just a ball bouncing off the walls.
5> Ball and Paddle classes brounght together. All required logic is added. delay() function is used for timing control.
6> Game class is defined. delay() replaced with time-based control, using millis() function.
